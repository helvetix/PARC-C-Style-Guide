The source for the document is a Scrivener document which is used to generate the LaTeX file, PARC-C-Style-Guide.tex

Open the PARC-C-Style-Guide.scriv file with the Scrivener application.
In that file, there are many sections.  Some of those sections are the TeX source for the document setup and so forth.

Edit what you need to edit and then "Compile" the file to "Plain Text" saving the result to a file that ends in .tex.
The result will simply be all of the text concatenated together.
At that point you can run make to generate the PDF from the TeX (LaTeX).

DON'T EDIT THE .tex FILE UNLESS YOU ARE ABANDONING THE SCRIVENER FILE.
